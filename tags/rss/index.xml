      <description>THE RESULT (Requires javascript)
When I started this project, my intention was to learn more about Javascript and the HTML5 canvas. I knew I wanted something interactive, and that a game would be an excellent place to begin. What started as a straight-forward tutorial project quickly began to teach me a valuable lesson about scope creep, among other things. All of those what-ifs can add weeks—if not months—to a project.

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a feeble attempt to stay up to date with the news without actually reading it (that&amp;rsquo;s what people do, right?). I wanted to write something that grabbed headlines from different sources to display overtop of another project I was working on. A little research turned up RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds in all their 2000&amp;rsquo;s glory. I dug around some more and looked for ways to encorporate them. This was actually a little more difficult than I&amp;rsquo;d originally thought.</description>
