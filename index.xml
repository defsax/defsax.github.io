      <title>Creating a Web Worker in Codepen</title>

      <description>In trying to find a way to integrate javascript projects into this blog without loading special seperate css and js files into my markdown, I came across some built-in hugo shortcode for codepen. After some tinkering I was able to embed codepen projects right into my markdown using just the slug
(as in: {{&amp;lt;codePen xxxxxxx&amp;gt;}}).
However I then ran into the issue of trying to load any generic worker.js file to get a web worker running.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip;For lack of a better title.
This application takes some user input, checks letter validity against a pre-written array of characters (so that the worker doesn&amp;rsquo;t run forever), then summons a web worker to randomly cycle the letters until the user word/phrase is found. You can control the worker delay using the slider input.
On github.
See the Pen Letter Scrambler by Perry (@defsax) on CodePen.  The user enters their word or phrase into the text box, then presses go.</description>
